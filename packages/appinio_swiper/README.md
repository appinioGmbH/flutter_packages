```appinio_swiper``` is a Flutter package for a Tinder Card Swiper. ✨

It allows swiping in all directions with any Custom Widget (Stateless or Statefull).

Very smooth animations supporting Android, iOS & WebApp.

## Why?

We build this package because we wanted to:

- have a complete customizable slider
- be able to swipe in every direction
- trigger unswipe however we want
- choose our own settings for the swiper such as duration, angle, padding..
- NEW: trigger swipe, swipe left and swipe right however we want
- NEW: add functions while un-/swiping, on end or when the swiper is disabled
- NEW: detect the direction (left, right, top, bottom) in which the card was swiped away
- NEW: unswipe all cards
- NEW: enable or disable horizontal and vertical swiping

## ❗NEW  Features ❗

### Trigger swipe left and swipe right through controller
You can now trigger swipe left and swipe right with our ```AppinioSwiperController``` regardless of the chosen ```AppinioSwipeDirection``` (which is still used when ```swipe``` is called through the controller). Just like the unswipe  and swipe call, you can call ```swipeLeft``` or ```swipeRight``` through the controller anywhere you want.

### Unswipe all cards
You can now unswipe as many cards as possible. If you set the parameter ```unlimitedUnswipe```to ```true``` (default value: ```false```) the limit of 1 card is extended to the number of cards that have been swiped away. The way to call ```unswipe``` hasn't changed.

### Detect direction of swipe
We've added the direction in which the card was swiped away to the function ```onSwipe```. The  ```AppinioSwipeDirection``` gets now returned when the function gets called.

### Sending Feedback when widget is unswiped
We've added the function ```unswipe``` that now gets returned with the boolean ```true``` when the last card is unswiped and with boolean ```false``` when there is no last card to unswipe.

### Trigger swipe through controller
You can now trigger the swipe with our ```AppinioSwiperController```. Just like the unswipe call, you can call the ```swipe``` trough the controller anywhere you want. Just make sure to pass the controller to the parameter ```controller``` from our ```AppinioSwiper```.


### Toggle for horizontal and vertical swiping
You can now use the `horizontalSwipeEnabled` and `verticalSwipeEnabled` to enable or disable swiping in the horizontal (left, right) and vertical (up, down) directions.

## Installation

Create a new project with the command
```yaml
flutter create MyApp
```
Add
```yaml
appinio_swiper: ...
```
to your `pubspec.yaml` of your flutter project.
**OR**
run

```yaml
flutter pub add appinio_swiper
```
in your project's root directory.


In your library add the following import:

```dart
import 'package:appinio_swiper/appinio_swiper.dart';
```

For help getting started with Flutter, view the online [documentation](https://flutter.io/).

## Usage
You can place your `AppinioSwiper` inside of a `Scaffold` or `CupertinoPageScaffold` like we did here. Optional parameters can be defined to enable different features. See the following example..

```dart
import 'package:appinio_swiper/appinio_swiper.dart';
import 'package:flutter/cupertino.dart';

class Example extends StatelessWidget {
  List<Container> cards = [
    Container(
      alignment: Alignment.center,
      child: const Text('1'),
      color: CupertinoColors.activeBlue,
    ),
    Container(
      alignment: Alignment.center,
      child: const Text('2'),
      color: CupertinoColors.activeBlue,
    ),
    Container(
      alignment: Alignment.center,
      child: const Text('3'),
      color: CupertinoColors.activeBlue,
    )
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return CupertinoPageScaffold(
      child: SizedBox(
        height: MediaQuery.of(context).size.height * 0.75,
        child: AppinioSwiper(
          cards: cards,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Constructor

| cards      | - | List of Widgets for the swiper | true
| controller      | - | Trigger unswipe | false
| padding      | EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 20, vertical: 25) | Control swiper padding | false
| duration      | 200 milliseconds    |   The duration that every animation should last | false
| maxAngle | 30      |    Maximum angle the card reaches while swiping | false
| threshold | 50     |    Threshold from which the card is swiped away | false
| isDisabled | false      |   Set to ```true``` if swiping should be disabled, has no impact when triggered from the outside | false
| onTapDisabled | -     |    Function that get triggered when the swiper is disabled | false
| onSwipe | -    |    Called with the new index and detected swipe direction when the user swiped | false
| onEnd | -    |    Called when there is no Widget left to be swiped away | false
| direction | right    |    Direction in which the card is swiped away when triggered from the outside | false
| allowUnswipe | true   |    Set to ```false``` if unswipe should be disabled away | false
| unlimitedUnswipe | false   |    Set to ```true``` if the user can unswipe as many cards as possible | false
| unswipe | -   |    Called with the boolean ```true``` when the last card gets unswiped and with the boolean ```false``` if there is no card to unswipe | false
| horizontalSwipeEnabled      | true | Allow swiping in the left and right directions | false
| verticalSwipeEnabled      | true | Allow swiping in the up and down directions | false

#### Controller

The ```Controller``` is used to control the ```swipe```, ```swipeLeft```, ```swipeRight``` or ```unswipe``` function of the swiper from outside of the widget. You can create a controller called ```AppinioSwiperController``` and save the instance for further usage. Please have a closer look to our Example for the usage.

| Method        | Description
| ------------- |:-------------
| swipe      | Changes the state of the controller to swipe and swipes the card in your selected direction.
| swipeLeft      | Changes the state of the controller to swipe left and swipes the card to the left side.
| swipeRight      | Changes the state of the controller to swipe right and swipes the card to the right side.
| unswipe      | Changes the state of the controller to unswipe and brings back the last card that was swiped away.
