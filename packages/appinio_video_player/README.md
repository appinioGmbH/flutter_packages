## Getting started

- To get started just create a VideoPlayerController as you would for the normal video_player and define a source to use.
- Secondly create a CustomVideoPlayerController to access the fullscreen and control bar visibility switches by yourself. Pass the controllers to a CustomVideoPlayer widget to use all its functionality and customisation oppurtunities.
- Secondly create a CustomVideoPlayerController and pass it the created VideoPlayerController as well as your custom settings or additional video sources
- On the examples tab is a selection of parameters you can customize to your needs. There you can also see how the additional video sources are added in case you want the user to be able to switch between video qualities

## Usage

```dart
class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  late VideoPlayerController videoPlayerController;
  late CustomVideoPlayerController _customVideoPlayerController;

  String videoUrl =
      "http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    videoPlayerController = VideoPlayerController.network(videoUrl)
      ..initialize().then((value) => setState(() {}));
    _customVideoPlayerController = CustomVideoPlayerController(
      context: context,
      videoPlayerController: videoPlayerController,
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _customVideoPlayerController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return CupertinoPageScaffold(
      navigationBar: CupertinoNavigationBar(
        middle: Text(widget.title),
      ),
      child: SafeArea(
        child: CustomVideoPlayer(
          customVideoPlayerController: _customVideoPlayerController
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
